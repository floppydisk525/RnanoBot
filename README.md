# RnanoBot
This github repository contains the KiCAD files and supporting documents for an Arduino Nano shield containing a TB6612 motor driver chip and LSM9DS1TR 9DOF IMU.  

The TB6612 circuit was influenced from https://github.com/floppydisk525/BoxBotCtrlBrd, which in turn was influenced from https://github.com/BoxBots/control-board.  

The LSM9DS1TR chip was influenced from sparkfun projects such as https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13944 and others.  

The repository name RnanoBot comes from "aRduino NANO roBOT" motor shield with TB6612 &amp; LSM9DS1TR
