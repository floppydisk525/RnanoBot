Chris Gammell's youtube video notes on KiCAD 5.1 and github
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGix1oYhTRs


1. Create new repository on the web.
	Select .gitignore KICAD and MIT License
2. Clone repository on local system.  
	2.1	Copy link to clip board  from github (https://github.com/floppydisk525/RnanoBot.git)
	2.2 git clone https://github.com/floppydisk525/RnanoBot.git
		Note - directory is created in the folder that you issue the command.  So do not 
		create a directory the name of your git project because then the folder will be
		.../documents/somefolder/projfold/projfold  
		Issue the git clone command in the /somefolder/ folder...
3.  Copy files to new direcotry, may need to change KiCAD file names to match folder that the
	files are saved in.
